#  MySQL : Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this app, I was able to  architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

  
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  
```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
